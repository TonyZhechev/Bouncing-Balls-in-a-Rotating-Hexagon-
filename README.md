🎮 Bouncing Balls in a Rotating Hexagon
📌 Overview
This Python project simulates two bouncing balls inside a rotating hexagon using Pygame. The balls interact with the hexagon's moving walls, affected by gravity, friction, and realistic collisions.

The project demonstrates:
✅ Physics Simulation – Realistic gravity, friction, and bouncing behavior.
✅ Dynamic Environment – The hexagon rotates, affecting ball movement.
✅ Collision Mechanics – Walls and balls respond naturally to interactions.
✅ Smooth Animations – Optimized rendering with Pygame.

🔹 Ideal for game physics enthusiasts, Python developers, and those learning Pygame & simulation mechanics.

🚀 Features
🎯 Realistic Ball Movement – Gravity & friction slow balls down over time.
🔄 Rotating Hexagon – The walls constantly move, making physics more challenging.
🏀 Wall Collisions – Balls bounce off moving walls with proper angle reflections.
⚙️ Optimized Performance – Smooth animations with vector math.
🎨 Object-Oriented Code – Easy to modify and extend.
